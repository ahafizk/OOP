# Object Oriented Programming Concept (OOP)

In this project, I explored the concept of Object Oriented Programming concept using C++.


In this work, I have a number class and two other classes that inherits the number class. One of them is Integer and another is Fraction. 
Fraction contains two integer parts. Fraction has been shown in the original form (i.e. 2/4 is displayed, but not diplayed the simplified form 1/2 or 0.5).
Supported operations add two numbers (Interger or integer and fraction or fraction), check equality of the numbers.
